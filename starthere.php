          <h1>My name is Tamara</h1><br>
          <p>
          I lead an active life, one of which includes being the fortunate captain of CCNM's dragon boat team, The Deadly Nightshades.  My other passion is reading (set me up in with some large windows, some  jazzy beats in the background and I'll stay put with a book for hours, days if I could).  I also love all things music.  I'm currently a cellist who plays with the occasional band, but aspires to play on big stages one day!</p>
          <br><blockquote>"Health means to be free to focus on your one thing."</blockquote><br>
          <p>
          With health on your side you are free to do all that you want and can do, to have capacity for deep mental focus and cognitive clarity, and motivation.  You are able to feel at peace with how you live, being a meaningful, valuable contributor in our world - and eventually leaving a lasting impact in the lives of a few or many.

          I believe you have a purpose, a goal, a vision to make reality.
          That thing that makes in life that makes your heart beat just a beat faster, makes you forget to breathe, and your eyes sparkle.
