            <h1>Health on Purpose</h1><br>
            <p>Do you believe that your health is one of your top priorities in life?
            <br><br>
            Most people agree, that their personal health is one of the most valuable things that they possess.
            <br><br>
            You want to eat healthier, push your fitness, lose weight, find the latest treatment for your condition, and continue to scour for the latest, most effective ways to optimize your health.
            <br><br>
            But I'm here to challenge you to think otherwise.
            <br><br>
            Good health is not your ultimate priority - it's not your final destination! If you really dig into why you want to be healthy, I can guarantee that you'll find a powerful underlying motivation.

            This site is dedicated to shifting your perspective on health within the context of the dreams, the passions, and purpose for which you live for. When you can reframe the role good health plays within a greater context, sticking with your health goals becomes much more easy and dare I say it... even enjoyable?!
            <br><br>
            This is for you, the dedicated, aspiring, and unlimited flame!
